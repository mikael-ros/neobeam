## Want to work on the codebase?
Feel free to do so.

### 🛠 Prerequisites
- Git

#### Optionally (highly recommended)
- Visual Studio Code
- Marp Extension for Visual Studio Code

If you do not have either of these, you must have adequate knowledge in how to use Marp in other ways. If your changes aren't breaking, it's all the same regardless.

### Instructions
Simply clone or fork the repo, create a branch, and follow the instructions of usage in the [readme](README.md).

To generate new preview images, run the ``create-previews.sh`` script in the [``example``](/example/) folder (do so while in that directory). You may need to ``chmod`` it first.
